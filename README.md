# Northcoders News API

In order to run this repo locally, once forked and cloned you will have to add 2 .env files to the root of the cloned repo, these files should be named .env.development and .env.test

In the .env.development file you will need the following line PGDATABASE=nc_news and in .env.test you will need PGDATABASE=nc_news_test. 

After adding these 2 files the repo should run locally without issue.
